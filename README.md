# Classification-and-Counting-of-Vehicles-on-the-Road-with-Image-Processing
Image processing project in MatLab that counts the vehicles moving on the road by distinguishing **between big and small**.

While developing the project, MatLab Computer Vision Toolbox was used. Many operations such as detecting moving vehicles, framing, and determining the center point were performed with MatLab Computer Vision Toolbox.
